# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Working on getting this Github ready to start my coding journey from tomorrow. I am doing the UDEMY 100 days of coding course with Angela. 

**Thoughts:** I have done simple python exercises prior to this so I am hoping to learn alot. I hope that I am using Github accordingly. Haven't really been able to understand the fork menu properly and I have started to use the template.
